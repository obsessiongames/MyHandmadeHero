- Around ~9min and before, Casey talks about pointer aliasing (this is when we are changing from RECT* to RECT in win32UpdateWindow(....)
- Also, I _think_ Casey says something about RECT being reasonably small...but is it? 4 x LONG which is 4 x 4  = 16 bytes I believe
- Around 12:25 - the redefn of variables in a loop discussion (incld destructor/ctor when dealing with classes)
- 33:51 (a bit before) - the segfault. Bitmap->Memory gets value 0x000000 - so can't write to location 0 (in virtual mem)? Protected?
